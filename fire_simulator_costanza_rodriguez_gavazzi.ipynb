    "The random variable involved in updating the grid is actually used in the propagate function.\n",

    "Each one of these types has an arbitrary number between 0 and 1 associated to is: this number represents the likelihood *p* of the cell catching fire.\n",

    "Based on the numbers of burning neighbors I have created a factor, which is then multiplied to *p*, increasing it. \n",

    "Therefore, the probability that i catch fire depends on the status of my neighboring cells.\n",

    "The propagate function determines whether a cell at position (x, y) in the grid should change its state (e.g., from GRASS to BURNING) based on probabilistic calculations: it checks the type of the current cell, computes the neighbors of the cell, and counts how many of those neighbors are in a burning state. It then calculates the probability of the cell catching fire, taking into account the type-specific ignition probability and the number of burning neighbors. Finally, it generates a random number to compare with the calculated probability to decide whether the cell ignites or remains the same.\n",

    "These transition probabilities are determined independently for each cell in the grid based on its current state and the states of its neighbors.\n",
    "The simulation iteratively updates the grid over time, and the state of each cell at each time step depends only on the previous time step's state, adhering to the Markov property.\n",
    "Regarding the number of Markov chains involved, there is one Markov chain for each cell in the grid. Each cell undergoes state transitions independently based on its own characteristics and the states of its neighbors.

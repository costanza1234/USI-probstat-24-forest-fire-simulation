# Forest Fire Propagation Simulator

This project simulates the propagation of forest fires using various algorithms and models. It aims to provide insights into how fires spread in different conditions and can be used for educational purposes, research, or practical applications in fire management.

## Features

- Simulate fire spread in a forest grid
- Visualize fire propagation over time
- Adjust parameters like wind speed, humidity, and vegetation type
- Analyze the impact of different conditions on fire behavior

## Installation

To run the simulator, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries.
